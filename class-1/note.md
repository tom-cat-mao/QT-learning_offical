## A Pretty Button

**QT objects have a lot of attributes that can be modified using getters and setters.**
**In QT, if an attribute is called *foo*, the associated getter and setter will have these signatures**

```#cpp
T foo() const;
void setFoo(const T);
```

**Qt extends this system of attributes and getters and setters to *propertty*.**
**A property is a value of any type that can be accessed, be modified or constant, and can notify a change.**
* text
* font
* tooltip
* icon
* etc.
